		What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about? <br /> <br />
		I managed to show error messages using Javascript, and also have managed to make the CSS files link and look visually appealing.
		</li>
	
		<li>
		Which parts did you have trouble with?  <br /> <br />
		At first I had problems with the database but managed to find out that is was quite simple if I got it right. I also had problems with the preg_match to get the
combination right. And lastly I had problems with using the permission fields and getting its value as a string to store in the database. 
		</li>
		
		<li>
		What would you like to do better next time? <br /> <br />
		I would make the UI better next time by making it more appealing, and if possible do live search in the search system page.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?  <br /> <br />
		The main resources I used were the lecture slides and the demo code because they are very good in helping me understand how things work, and how to do things. This includes the demo codes.
		Another reference I used is http://www.w3schools.com/ because it has everything to teach about HTML/CSS/PHP with demos, and it is helpful for beginners.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		What you have learnt along the way? <br /> <br />
		To be honest I have learnt so much while doing this assignment. To learn PHP, HTML, and CSS was great! I am glad to say that I have coded a basic functional website from scratch!
		This is because of all the help of the good Lecturer and lab TA.
